** DRSGME

And isometric camera mode with orthographic projection for the gzdoom engine.
Made for the fork: https://github.com/dileepvr/gzdoom_isometric/tree/isocam_merge_test_Jun24
Should work with just about any iwad.

Consider playing with a sprites pack with all weapons and directions rendered for the player.

Created by Dileep V. Reddy

** Usage

Just run =make= and a =pk3= wad file will be generated in dumped into the [[./build]] directory.
Alternatively, you could zip the whole repository and rename the file extension to =pk3=.

Then, after you've built =gzdoom= from the above fork, load the wad in
at the end. Over the command line, command is:

#+begin_src
  > ./gzdoom -iwad <IWAD-FILE> -file <FULL-PATH-TO-DRSGME.pk3>
#+end_src

** Controls

There are keys you can bind to rotate camera about the center, and
zoom it in or out. The [[./keyconf.lmp]] file contains some suggested
default binds. A key can be bound to toggle aim assist. Most other
options (camera pitch, fog of war, dithered transparency) can be
changed in the dedicated section in the options menu. Player
strafe-movement controls get mapped based on direction the player
faces relative to the camera.
